## Getting Started {-}

### Load packages {-}

In this lab, you will explore the data using the `dplyr` package and visualize the data with the `ggplot2` package. The data can be found in the
companion package for this course, `statsr`.

Start by loading the packages `statsr`, `dplyr`, `scales`, and `ggplot2`.

```{r, label = "load-packages"}
library(statsr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(scales)
```

### The data {-}

This lab uses real estate data from the city of Ames, Iowa. The details of every real estate transaction in Ames is recorded by the City Assessor's office. The particular focus for this lab will be all residential home sales in Ames between 2006 and 2010.  This collection represents the population of interest. In this lab, you will learn about these home sales by taking smaller samples from the full population. Start by loading the data.

```{r, label = "load-data"}
data(ames)  
```

There are `r dim(ames)[2]` variables in the `ames` data set. For this lab, you will only use two of the variables: the above ground living area of the house in square feet (`area`) and the sale price (`price`).

To explore the distribution of the homes' `area`s in the population of home sales with a histogram consider Figure \@ref(fig:area-hist).

```{r, label = "area-hist", fig.cap = "Histogram of `area` (square feet)", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = ames, aes(x = area)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 250, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  labs(x = "Square feet", y = "Count") +
  theme_bw()
```

Summary statistics can be computed using the `summarize` function from `dplyr`. One can calculate as many statistics as needed  using this function. Some of the functions below should be self explanatory (like `mean`, `median`, `sd`, `IQR`, `min`, and `max`).  A new function here is the `quantile` function, which can be used to calculate  values corresponding to specific percentile cutoffs in the distribution. For example `quantile(x, 0.25)` will yield the cutoff value for the 25^th^ percentile (Q1) in the distribution of `x`. Finding appropriate values is useful for characterizing the  distribution. The values are used for descriptions such as *"the middle 50% of the homes have areas between such and such square feet."*

```{r,  label = "area-stats"}
POP <- ames %>%
  summarize(mu = mean(area), pop_med = median(area), 
            sigma = sd(area)*sqrt((length(area) - 1)/length(area)), pop_iqr = IQR(area),
            pop_min = min(area), pop_max = max(area),
            pop_q1 = quantile(area, 0.25),  # first quartile, 25th percentile
            pop_q3 = quantile(area, 0.75),  # third quartile, 75th percentile
            G1 = e1071::skewness(area))
knitr::kable(POP, caption = "Population Parameters", col.names = c("$\\mu$", "$\\theta$", "$\\sigma$", "$\\text{IQR}$", "$\\text{MIN}$", "$\\text{MAX}$", "$\\text{Q}_1$", "$\\text{Q}_3$", "$\\text{G}_1$"))
```

## The unknown sampling distribution {-}

In this lab, the entire population is present, but this is rarely the  case in real life. Gathering information on an entire population is often  extremely costly or even impossible. Because of this, one will often take a sample of the population and use that sample to infer properties of the population.

If one were interested in estimating the mean living area in Ames based on a 
sample, one could use the following command to take a simple random sample (sampling without replacement) of size $n = 50$ from the population.

```{r, label = "samp1"}
samp1 <- ames %>%
  sample_n(size = 50)
```

This command creates a simple random sample of `size` 50 from the `ames` data-set and assigns the sample to `samp1`. This emulates going into the City Assessor's database and pulling up the files on 50 random home sales. Working with these 50 files would be considerably simpler than working with all 2930 home sales.

________

<div id="exercise">
**Exercise 1:** Describe the distribution of this sample? How does it compare to the distribution of the population? **Hint:** `sample_n` function takes a random sample of observations (i.e. rows) from the data-set, you can still refer to the variables in the data-set with the same names. Code you used in the previous exercise will also be helpful for visualizing and summarizing the sample; however, be careful not to label values `mu` and `sigma` anymore since these are sample statistics, not population parameters. You can customize the labels of any of the statistics to indicate that these come from the sample.

When reporting area be sure to report with proper units.  That is, $\text{ft}^2$.

**If** one were interested in estimating the average living area in homes in Ames using the sample, the best single guess is the sample mean.

```{r label = "mean-samp1"}
samp1 %>%
  summarize(xbar = mean(area))
```

Depending on which 50 homes one selects, their estimate could be above or below the true population mean of `r round(POP$mu,2)` square feet. However, the sample mean is the best unbiased estimate of the population mean (average living area), and we were able to get it by sampling less than 3\% of the population.

_________

2. Suppose we took two more samples, one of size 100 and one of size 1000. Which would you think would provide a more accurate estimate of the population mean?
<ol>
<li> Sample size of 50. </li>
<li> Sample size of 100. </li>
<li> Sample size of 1000. </li>
</ol>

Take one more sample of size 50, and compute the mean `area` of this sample:
```{r label = "mean-samp2"}
ames %>%
  sample_n(size = 50) %>%
  summarize(x_bar = mean(area))
```

Not surprisingly, every time a new random sample is generated, the resulting sample mean is generally different. It is useful to develop a sense of just how much variability one  should expect when estimating the population mean this way. The distribution  of sample means, called the *sampling distribution*, can help one understand  this variability. In this lab, because you have access to the population, you  can build up the sampling distribution for the sample mean by repeating the  above steps many times. Consider the following code where the mean of 15,000 samples each of size $n = 50$ is computed.  Note that the sampling for the sampling distribution is done with replacement.

```{r label = "loop"}
sample_means50 <- ames %>%
                    rep_sample_n(size = 50, reps = 15000, replace = TRUE) %>%
                    group_by(replicate) %>% 
                    summarize(x_bar = mean(area))
```

```{r, label = "SampleMean", fig.cap = "Sampling distribution of the sample mean", echo = FALSE}
ggplot(data = sample_means50, aes(x = x_bar)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = expression(bar(x))) 
```

In the previous code, `R` generates 15,000 samples each of size 50 from the population, computes the mean of each sample of size 50, and stores the result in a vector (`x_bar`) of the `sample_means50` tibble.

## Interlude: Sampling distributions {-}

The idea behind the `rep_sample_n` function is *repetition*. Earlier, a single sample of size $n = 50$ was taken from the population of all houses in Ames. With this new function, one is able to repeat this sampling procedure `rep` times in order to build a distribution of a series of sample statistics, called the  **simulated sampling distribution**.  The set of all possible values of the statistic and the frequency with which those values occur is the theoretical sampling distribution.

Note that in practice, one rarely gets to build theoretical sampling distributions because we rarely have access to data from the entire population. 

Without the `rep_sample_n` function, this would be tedious. The following code would have to be run 15,000 times  manually.

```{r, label = "sample-code", eval = FALSE}
ames %>%
  sample_n(size = 50) %>%
  summarize(x_bar = mean(area))
```

The resulting sample means would be stored each time in a separate object.

Note that for each of the 15,000 times a mean was computed, it was done from a **different** sample!

## Sample size and the sampling distribution {-}

Mechanics aside, consider the reason one used the `rep_sample_n` function: to compute a sampling distribution, specifically, the one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:hist).

```{r, label = "hist", fig.cap = "Sampling distribution of the sample mean ($\\bar{x}$)"}
ggplot(data = sample_means50, aes(x = x_bar)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 20, fill = "lightblue", color = "black") + 
  theme_bw() + 
  labs(x = expression(bar(x)))
```

The sampling distribution computed in Figure \@ref(fig:hist) informs the reader 
about the average living area in homes in Ames.  Because the sample mean is an 
unbiased estimator, the theoretical sampling distribution is centered at the true average living area of the population, and the theoretical spread of the distribution indicates how much variability is induced by sampling only 50 home sales.

In the remainder of this section, exercises are presented to show the reader the effect sample size has on the resulting sampling distributions.
